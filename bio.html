    <p>I am on the right.</p>

    <p>I was born in New York on October 9th, 1992. Growing up I lived in a town called Long Beach. When I graduated high school, I moved down to Orlando to attend UCF. After 4 years as a student I graduated with a degree in mathematics education. I was then hired to Orange County Public Schools in Orlando. Lastly, after 5 years I decided I wanted a career change and I am not learning computer coding from UCF.</p>
